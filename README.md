LEAP-YEAR CHECKER

##Author

## Description

The project is used to confirm if an year inserted by the user is a leap year. It uses a loop to achieve this function since the number keyed in
by the user is taken through various Mathematical steps where it is divided by 4, 100, and 400 and if the modulo is 0, the output is displayed
saying the year is a leap year. If it is not divisible by neither, one or all of them the output is that the year is not a leap year
